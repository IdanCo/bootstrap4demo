# webpack-modular

A scaffold of a frontend project which implements some of the best practices to harnest the powers of [webpack 2](https://webpack.js.org/). The app itself is based on [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/), but most aspects of the bundling process are relevant to any stack.

Based on the architecture described in the Medium article - **[A Webpack Setup that Makes Sense](https://medium.com/@Idan_Co/a-webpack-setup-that-makes-sense-35b4b6b8ef5f)**
